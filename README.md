Cranial Check
======

## 1. Project Owners

Alyzee and Carissa

## 2. Intro & Goal

Due to the transition to online platforms for work, school, and other daily activities, many people have experienced worsening syptoms in the ocular/cranial areas. Our Cranial Check symptom checker will prompt the user to enter their symptoms and use a model to highlight pain areas that will result in a few possible diagnoses. The tool will then provide a resources for treatment and next steps according to quiz results.

## 2. Who is it for?

Target audiences are those who are computers for most of the day and are experiencing pain or other symptoms in their eyes and head. Because the Qoom community is full of programmers, coders, designers and people who may use their computer very often, the symptom checker will be easily accessible for anyone that wants to know what conditions their symptoms can indicate. 

## 3. Why build it?

By making this project, we hope to provide an easy tool for the general public (without medical knowledge) to gain some understanding of their medical conditions and find possible treatments. As a self-diagnostic tool, it is not meant to replace a medical professional but rather be a preliminary symptom checker. This tool is also important as it allows people to easily stay conscious of their health and take the appropriate action as necessary.
